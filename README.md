# zuri_rock_paper_scissors

A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player “throw” his selection into the middle. Rock is designated by maintaining the fist, Scissors by extending the middle and index fingers to form a V shape, and Paper by holding the hand out flat. 

The hand signals are given simultaneously by both (or more) players, and the game has only two possible outcomes other than a tie. If players throw out the same gesture, it is a tie so the game goes on. If not, the winner is decided by a harmonic and intransitive method — rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, but paper covers rock.
